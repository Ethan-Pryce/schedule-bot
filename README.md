Welcome to the display repository for https://schedule-bot.com/
This is not the functional code as pieces have been removed for security.

This is a service I provide to help you organize an event with a group of people.

Please feel free to reach out and ask me any questions.

This webapp is written using the MERN stack and is hosted on Netlify with Vercel as the backend (formerly Heroku). Check the schedule-backend repository for the backend code.

The app uses Google accounts to keep track of users. Manages a MongoDB to keep track of room to user relationship. Then when in a room calls the databases records to check if anything has changed.

Files ending in Screen or Redirect are pages. Components make up parts of pages.
